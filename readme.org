* 9

9 is my second game ever.  It's more fun than my first.  Play it!




** How to play
 - WASD/Arrow keys/Numpad for movement
 - Mouse for aiming
 - P, Tab, Escape, and I all pause the game.

*** About

This was made over the first 2 or 3 weeks of the spring 2012 semester.
I'm pretty much done with it now (unless I find any particularly
terrible bugs), but I might come back to it in the future.  It
basically has 2 levels, though after that it will keep generating them
until you die.  The code isn't the best (but then again I've never
claimed to be great at OO), so don't think too much about it if you
take a look at the inside.
