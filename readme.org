* 9

9 is my second game ever.  It's more fun than my first.  Play it!



** How to play
 - WASD/Arrow keys/Numpad for movement
 - Mouse for aiming
 - P, Tab, Escape, and I all pause the game.

For more, see the in-game help menu

*** About

9 was made during the first 3 weeks of the spring 2012 semester.  As I
mention above, it is my second game ever, my first being W (jeez,
whats with the one character names, huh?).  It's came out very nicely
and I feel like it's quite slick.  It also refamiliarized me with
Java (and how much I dislike it), and allowed me to figure out how
games are made.  I hope you enjoy it!
